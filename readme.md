Use alpaca markets to fetch market data (for stocks), use streamlit (future work: use good charting library and nice CSS styling) to plot daily chart of watchlist stocks (future work; implement time frame slectors to see different interval of the stock chart), populate stocks with levels dictionary, run a buy low sell high backest - demo performance with that

Lots to - do 

python -m venv stock-app
source stock-app/bin/activate
pip install streamlit alpaca-trade-api plotly bokeh==2.4.3 pandas


pip install streamlit alpaca-trade-api plotly



pip install streamlit alpaca-trade-api bokeh==2.4.3 pandas --force-reinstall --no-deps
